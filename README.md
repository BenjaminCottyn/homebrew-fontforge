# homebrew-fontforge

This is the 20161012 version of the FontForge homebrew formula.
See the original [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/d1dfe7b506da542c8828ebd775a1f4f943e55ed7/Formula/fontforge.rb).

## Installation

Use `brew tab benjamincottyn/fontforge` to enable this formula and `brew tap-pin benjamincottyn/fontforge` to prioritize it over the FontForge formula in homebrew-core.

After that, a `brew install fontforge` will take care of the rest.
